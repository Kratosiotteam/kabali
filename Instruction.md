Kratos Trojan
=================

A simple trojan keylogger written in Python, disguised as an animated ASCII bunny (made for pedagogical purposes)

Usage
-----

- In a first console (attacker's console) , run 'python kratosServer.py'
- In another console (victim's console), run 'python kratosTrojan.py'
- If the victim presses keys anywhere in your OS and watch the server getting logs of which keys victim pressed.
